# T-DATA-007: Execution - Complete Migration & Validation

**Created:** 2025-09-13
**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Time:** 1 day
**Dependencies:** T-DATA-001 through T-DATA-006
**Status:** Not Started

## Objective

Execute the complete migration of all existing datasets to the new structure and validate the reorganization's success through comprehensive testing.

## Context

With all data pipeline infrastructure in place (T-DATA-001 through T-DATA-006), this task focuses on:
- **Executing the actual migration** of all datasets using the implemented systems
- **Comprehensive validation** that migration preserved data integrity and improved organization
- **Performance benchmarking** to ensure new structure meets or exceeds current performance
- **Final cleanup** of redundant directory structures
- **End-to-end testing** of the complete pipeline

This is the culmination task that brings together all previous infrastructure work.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Complete execution of all migration operations (Portuguese, multilingual, commentary)
- Comprehensive validation using all implemented audit systems
- Performance testing and benchmarking against current structure
- Cleanup of redundant/obsolete directories (bibles-2024/, duplicates)
- End-to-end pipeline testing with real data
- Documentation of migration results and any issues encountered

### Out of Scope
- New feature development (focus on migration execution only)
- Performance optimization beyond validation (separate task if needed)
- API integration changes (pipeline reorganization should be transparent to API)

## Migration Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Validation
```bash
# 1. Verify all systems are operational
make data-setup                    # Ensure directory structure
python scripts/analyze_languages.py  # Verify language detection

# 2. Create comprehensive backup
cp -r data/datasets data/datasets.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 3. Generate baseline reports
python manage.py data audit integrity --report-file reports/pre-migration-integrity.json
python manage.py data audit coverage --report-file reports/pre-migration-coverage.json
```

### Phase 2: Execute Migration
```bash
# 1. Full migration execution
python manage.py data migrate full --report-file reports/migration-full.json

# Alternative: Step-by-step execution
python manage.py data migrate portuguese-bibles --report-file reports/migrate-pt.json
python manage.py data migrate multilingual-bibles --report-file reports/migrate-multi.json
python manage.py data migrate commentary-authors --report-file reports/migrate-authors.json
```

### Phase 3: Post-Migration Validation
```bash
# 1. Comprehensive integrity checks
python manage.py data audit integrity --fail-on-missing --report-file reports/post-migration-integrity.json
python manage.py data audit i18n --threshold 0.95 --report-file reports/post-migration-i18n.json
python manage.py data audit coverage --report-file reports/post-migration-coverage.json

# 2. Maintenance verification
python manage.py data maintenance verify --report-file reports/post-migration-maintenance.json

# 3. Directory health check
python manage.py data maintenance report --report-file reports/post-migration-status.json
```

### Phase 4: Performance Validation
```bash
# 1. API performance testing
python manage.py test tests.performance.test_api_performance
python manage.py test tests.performance.test_data_loading

# 2. Data access benchmarks
time python manage.py data audit coverage  # Measure processing time
```

### Phase 5: Cleanup and Finalization
```bash
# 1. Remove redundant directories
python manage.py data migrate cleanup-old --remove-bibles-2024

# 2. Final validation
python manage.py data maintenance verify

# 3. Generate migration summary
python manage.py data maintenance report --report-file reports/final-migration-summary.json
```
